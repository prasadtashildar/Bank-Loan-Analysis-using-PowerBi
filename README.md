# Bank-Loan-Analysis-using-PowerBi
This project presents an interactive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize critical insights from a bank's loan dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of loan applications, approval trends, and financial metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Features
1. Summary Dashboard:
Displays key metrics such as:
Total Applications: 39K
Total Funded Loan Amount: $436M
Total Received Amount: $473M
Interest Rate and DTI Metrics
Visualized proportions of Good Loans (86%) and Bad Loans (14%), with detailed funded and received amounts.

2. Overview Dashboard:
Tracks loan applications over time, states, and employee lengths.
Includes insights on:
Loan purpose distribution (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card, etc.)
Ownership type (e.g., rent, mortgage).
Loan term analysis (36 months vs. 60 months).

Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI: To create visualizations and interactive dashboards.
SQL: For preprocessing and querying the dataset.
Data Transformation: Cleaned and prepared data for accurate reporting.

Insights Derived:
Month-over-month (MOM) and month-to-date (MTD) metrics highlight application growth and financial performance.
Bad loans contribute significantly to total interest but represent a smaller percentage of overall funded amounts.
Loan purpose and term distributions offer actionable insights for customer segmentation.
